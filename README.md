# The Resident Zombie - Frontend

## Introduction

The Resident Zombie is a project for helping survivors in a Zombie Apocalypse. The frontend is made in React, using react-router for locally routing, styled-components for CSS-in-JS styling, Formik for form handling and Yup for validation.
The web app is responsive, so it is easily adapted for mobiles.
